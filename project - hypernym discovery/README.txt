- train_sem_model: trains the semantic models, but the corpus files are needed. Once the execution is done (several hours later), the final model is saved in this directory.
- Neither the corpus nor the models are included in this zip because of their huge sizes.
- deliverable: this is basically the code of the project. It loads the model generated with the previous script, reads the data from the SemEval2018-Task9 folder and outputs a file in that same subfolder with the requested output (output.txt for English and output_spanish.txt for Spanish)
- paper: all the documentation and analysis of the task.
